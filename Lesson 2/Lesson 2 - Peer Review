"""
A regular polygon has n number of sides. Each side has length s.

The area of a regular polygon is: (.25*n*s^2)/(tan(pi/n))
The perimeter of a polygon is: length of the boundary of the polygon
Write a function called polysum that takes 2 arguments, n and s. \
This function should sum the area and square of the perimeter of the regular polygon. \
The function returns the sum, rounded to 4 decimal places.
